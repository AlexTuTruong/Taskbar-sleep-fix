# Taskbar Sleep Fix

### Tired of your hidden taskbar and app icons breaking after your computer goes to sleep?

The this is the fix for you! This is a simple batch script which restarts the `explorer.exe` which will fix taskbar issues with a simple double click of the script!

## Installing and running

Visit the [releases](https://github.com/AlexTuTruong/Taskbar-sleep-fix/releases) and download the latest version of the script.

There are 2 versions of the script: 

1. `FixTaskbar.bat`

    and

2. `FixTaskbarFast.bat`

Version `1` gives you a visual indicator of what the script is doing.

Version `2` runs the script as fast as possible if you don't have time for fancy text and/or animations.

Running the script should be as simple as double clicking the shortcut in the location it's been downloaded to.

You may see a prompt saying `Windows protected your Pc` and you need to "trust the program" or click `Run anyway`. You can read the source code first if you do not trust the script.
